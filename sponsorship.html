<h4>What?</h4>
<p>For Â£100 you can sponsor the One Thing Well RSS feed for a week.</p>
<p>Read on for more information, or <a href="mailto:jack@onethingwell.org">send me an email</a> to book a week's sponsorship.</p>
<h4>Who's reading?</h4>
<p>More than 36,000 people visit the site every month, viewing more than 50,000 pages<sup id="r1-031511"><a href="#f1-031511">1</a></sup>. Add more than 6,000 subscribers across Google Reader, Twitter and Tumblr and you get... well, not a <em>huge</em> number of people. But those people are hungry for new software and hardware, and they love telling their friends about their latest find.</p>
<p>Don't take my word for it, though. Here's what happened when I posted about DoublePane, a great Mac app that helps users manage their windows.</p>
<ol>
<li>DoublePane became the #1 utility and the #24 Paid App overall in the U.S. App store. (#2 Utility and #29 Paid App overall in the U.K.)</li>
<li>Sales jumped 380%</li>
<li>Twitter mentions of the term DoublePane more than quadrupled.</li>
</ol>
<p>And here's a graph showing DoublePane's sales, before and after the post:</p>

<h3>What do I get?</h3>
<p>'Sponsoring the RSS feed' is a blogger euphemism for <strong>one prominent post in praise of your product or service</strong>. I'd recommend the last post on a Friday, which goes out at 6pm GMT and stays at the top of the front page over the weekend, until 2pm GMT the following Monday, but I can post whenever you like.</p>
<p>If you'd like to try something different--a more traditional advert, for example--<a href="mailto:jack@onethingwell.org">send me an email</a> and we'll work something out.</p>
<h4>A note to readers</h4>
<p>I'm not a <em>total</em> sellout. I'll only accept sponsorship from nice companies who make cool stuff. Sponsored posts will be clearly marked as such. At the end of the year I'll donate 10% of the money I earn through sponsorship to open source projects.</p>
